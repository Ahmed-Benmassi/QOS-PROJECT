# QOS Network Supervision Tool (LITTLE UPDATE)

This is a Python-based Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring tool that collects and logs network performance metrics such as:

- Average latency (ms) via ping
- Packet loss (%)
- Network bandwidth usage (Mbps)

Metrics are written to an **InfluxDB** instance for analysis and visualization.

- Tracks network bandwidth usage via `psutil`
- Stores metrics in InfluxDB for easy dashboarding (e.g., Grafana)
